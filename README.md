<p align="center">
TurtlPass Firmware provides a simple and secure way of generating passwords using a deterministic key derivation function (HKDF) as specified in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5869">RFC 5869</a>.</p>

## ‚ö° Features

* Generates unique, secure passwords from a simple input hash
	* 100 characters long, including a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers
* Uses a seed stored in flash memory for added security
* Automatically types the password for you, so you don't have to
* Erases the password from memory after use, for extra peace of mind
* Easy to integrate into your existing projects with USB serial port connectivity


## üèóÔ∏è Hardware

<img src="assets/rpi-picos.jpg" width="100%">

1. **Raspberry Pi Pico**
2. **OTG Cable**: micro-USB (male) to USB-C (male)
3. **Cover/Case** (optional)


## üí° LED State

* `ON`
	* Operational (default)
* `PULSING`
	* Password ready to type
* `BLINKING`
	* Typing... (fast blink)
* `OFF`
	* No power input


## üîß Generate your own seed

1. Run the bash script `./generate_seed_file.sh` to generate a new seed file `Seed.cpp.<timestamp>` on a computer with macOS or Linux.

2. Rename the generated file to `Seed.cpp`.


## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è¬†Upload sketch


1. Open `turtlpass-firmware.ino` with Arduino IDE on a computer.

	> If the first time, select the appropriate **Board** and **Serial Port** in the Arduino menu `Tools`.

2. Connect the Raspberry Pico to a computer with a micro-USB to USB-C cable.

	> To upload your first sketch, you will need to hold the `BOOTSEL` button down while plugging in the Pico to a computer.

3. Click in the `Upload` icon to upload the sketch to the Pico

4. The sketch should be transferred and start to run.


## üêû Debugging

1. Open the **Serial Monitor** console
	> Settings: `Newline` and `115200` baud rate

2. Type, for example, `/0` and send it

3. You should get a response saying `OK` and the LED should be `PULSING`

4. Now press the button on Pico and the password should be typed (wherever the focus is on)


## üõ°Ô∏è Security

As a precaution, it is crucial to note that an individual with physical access to the device may potentially be able to compromise it, given sufficient time and effort.

<details>
  <summary>Raspberry Pi Pico</summary>
  
While the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico) (RP2040) is a useful device for development, it is not recommended for use in production settings. Due to the external ROM it utilizes, it is relatively easy to extract the firmware binary using [picotool](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool), making it challenging to protect against unauthorized access.

Example on how to do just that:

```
$ picotool save firmware.uf2
Saving file: [==============================]  100%
Wrote 369000 bytes to firmware.uf2
```

  <summary>Arduino RP2040 Connect</summary>
  
The [Arduino RP2040 Connect](https://thepihut.com/products/arduino-nano-rp2040-connect) features the **ATECC608A Cryptographic Co-processor** that includes hardware storage for cryptographic keys however to access certain features on this chip we need to contact Microchip and sign an NDA contract.</details>

  <summary>Other devices</summary>
  
I am continuously exploring and evaluating new hardware options for this project. As more information and resources become available, I will keep you updated on my progress.
